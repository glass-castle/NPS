It seems a lot of the opportunities Makers Academy are currently advertising (and I assume pursing behind the scenes) are for training schemes that are sponsored by a particular company who are looking to hire fresh talent and train them through Makers, I.e. often at apprenticeship level or targeted at those with little to no prior experience outside of engineering. From what I have seen, self-funded makers are usually no longer able to apply for these jobs having already done the course, and given that many of the companies choosing this route of recruitment will be supported by apprenticeship government funding, and will ultimately be getting applicants with the exact same training with lower salary expectations, it devalues self-funded Makers Graduates in the marketplace and makes us look like a comparatively bad deal. I totally understand why this is a business direction makers have decided to go down due to the opportunity to recruit directly onto the makers course, and that in the current climate it is a way of matching talent with jobs with a higher success rate than a ‘train and find jobs afterwards’ type model. That said, it leaves the self-funded Makers graduates in an odd place where we are unable to apply for the training schemes, our experience has been devalued in the market place by being an expensive option for the same training, whilst also competing in a market where there are experienced engineers going for roles that would historically be seen as being below their experience level.

It meant that I doubted the skills I had obtained through the course, because they didn't measure up to what was expected in these job adverts. eg. One track could be - Frontend: If you're hoping to work in a frontend role as your first job, we recommend the following plan: • Increase your knowledge of JavaScript. • Study React in more depth, or alternatively try out another framework like Vue. • Build and deploy a static web application using Vercel/Render etc • Practice working on JSON in the browser.

I was really lucky to secure a role through a Makers Hiring Partner but there were only a handful that came through when I was job searching.

My last interview with a Makers partner I received the feedback that I based on the strength of my code I would develop too quickly out of a junior position and therefore would not be offered the position. Nobody at Makers seemed to argue with this? This is just one example of the shambolic work the partnership team does.,"The partnership team does not get to know the Makers students and treats the hiring process like an anonymous job board. I paid £8.5k for this course for access to jobs and there have been maybe 11 since October last year, and twice their hiring partners have decided not to hire any makers at all. Why am I paying £8.5k for access to a below-average jobs board? They need to spend more time getting to know the students and what they're capable of. This can be done by attending the end of course presentations and seeing the projects that the students produce. To be honest my experience at Makers was not great overall, including work by the parternship team. The tutors often had no knowledge of the curriculum outside their unit and some were rude. I was paired with people who had no tech skills at all and more than halfway through the course had to be shown what an array is and on one occasion how to copy and paste and save a file. The course needs a complete overhaul. It's disgusting given the job market that the course is still taking on so many students and promising them jobs. I noticed recently that the ex CEO and one of the board members was talking on linkedin was working abroad so clearly someone is making use of that money!",1,2023-04-14 13:10:52,Form,27599401,Detractor

Workshops were also great too!,"Overall I think the support has been great, so really had to push myself to think of areas for improvement!  First, this is VERY minor but we had one workshop that never happened due to a team member being away (and was never rescheduled), perhaps just fell off the radar and no one flagged it.   Otherwise, I think perhaps managing expectations before students graduate around how many hiring partners are in the pipeline could be helpful. Not sure if this is just my cohort, but a lot of October had the impression that there would be a chunky handful of roles to apply to when finishing. There was a general perception throughout the course that there’s a constant line of hiring partners coming to Makers. It’s not until you’re on the ‘other side’ of the course that you understand the volume of roles on offer, and a handful of people in my cohort were a bit taken aback initially. So perhaps giving a bit of a heads up around the number of opportunities available might help people get into the job hunting zone / mindset a little faster.   Lastly, one thing that stood out to me in interviews was how often I was asked to explain concepts like OOP, etc. These are all things we covered at Makers, but I think a lot of us just skim over “the theory” and prioritise building coding skills / confidence. Perhaps in the materials, when these concepts are introduced, there could be little flags to say “heads up: this is the sort of concept you might need to talk about in an interview”. For me, this would’ve made me learn to explain them as I progressed through the course (vs ‘cramming’ definitions before an interview).",9,2023-02-08 08:25:59,Form,47142151,Promoter

Also I had an experience where I was applying for a role with Workforce & midway through my application, the role was given to someone outside of Makers. I understand that Makers did not know that Workforce ended up hiring from outside Makers whilst advertising the job within Makers, but I'd suggest to communicate with the company more as to if they have advertised the role elsewhere if they are also advertising it with Makers. I say this because I don't see the point of a company advertising a role to the Makers community whilst actively hiring for it behind the scenes. I know Makers did not know about it, so there is only so much you can do, but if they ask before the fair if the company is hiring elsewhere simultaneously, it will bring more certainty to if they are actually going to hire from Makers or not.",8,2022-09-05 10:19:44,Form,36574801,Passive

In general helped make the process a lot less overwhelming, and seeing how often people got hired was often inspiring.","A bit more transparency around the hub application would be nice. I did eventually find Becks' guide buried in the career cache which was extremely helpful, but it was hard to find and many other people I spoke to were under the assumption that we would be writing directly to the companies, and that companies would have looked at our GitHubs themselves. With the hub applications in general I think they are biased against younger people like myself with little experience, as that seems to be the main way to stand out from other hub applications. I knew I didn't have much experience going in to the course so thought focusing on improving my coding skills, learning the most technologies, and doing the best projects would help set me apart. Unfortunately I feel like this wasn't the case, and it was research into a company and networking at the careers cache that probably made the difference, so I feel frustrated that my hard work hasn't necessarily been rewarded. I bring this up because I really struggled to even get replies from companies when doing external applications (my CV was mostly projects with little experience), so I felt like hub applications would be my best chance. This was a big problem for me when applying as so many jobs wanted graduates or soon to be graduates;from an employers perspective, why hire someone young without a STEM degree who also doesn't have a wealth of experience from a previous career to offer instead?

The careers team is also very personable and attentive to individuals.,"Many Alumni agree that the sudden change in structure after graduation is difficult to adjust to. Remote/On-site stand-ups help, but perhaps something more could be done to help with this. My meetings with Max Roberts-Dear regarding career strategy and mock interview with Rupert Adams were both extremely valuable experiences, so I would thoroughly recommend sessions of this nature.",10,2019-08-14 12:29:50,,8274851,Promoter

Although lunch talks were very useful!",amazing! I felt supported on every stage of my application process. The careers team provided enough tools as well as explained the importance of each of them to utilise during job-hunting. I have also learned a lot about job-hunting useful beyond the career of the dev. Thank you! ❤️,10,2019-07-05 20:31:20,,7808451,Promoter
